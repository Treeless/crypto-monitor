##WEEKLIES:

Talking with OMAR - 2017-11-03
* Issue: No subreddit traffic

* RESEARCH: Papers -> Engagement - HISTORY
* How do they mine? Posts for engagement. Formula? Weights ;)
* Information Retrieval Papers
* Japan, wikipedia, scraping. Rank based on importance. What can we pull from these examples?
* OUTCOME: We need to create a library that will pull in reddit posts from a specific subreddit and rank each post based on upvotes, comments, golded comments, and all out engagement. Then using the ranking system, graph the weights alongside the price of the coin.
